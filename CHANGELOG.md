# Changelog

## [2.17.0](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/compare/v2.16.1...v2.17.0) (2026-09-10)


### Features

* **batch:** execute-slot, a one-shot execution plane with a machine-readable result ([#43](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/issues/43)) ([2dc135b](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/commit/2dc135b419f4b54fe42fb3cbdcfe13a43b0cc058))

## [2.16.1](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/compare/v2.16.0...v2.16.1) (2026-09-10)


### Bug Fixes

* **packaging:** bundle @redtidev/pixiv-client into the published tarball ([#35](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/issues/35)) ([1ee369b](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/commit/1ee369be1db79e742ae5b9ec39d3f9d8c7941456))

## [2.16.0](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/compare/v2.15.0...v2.16.0) (2026-09-10)


### Features

* **pixiv-client:** extract independent @redtidev/pixiv-client and migrate PixivFlow onto it ([3a67601](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/commit/3a676018a7109df36a55c8ce0dc9a4a9f71a29d3))

## [2.15.0](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/compare/v2.14.0...v2.15.0) (2026-09-10)


### Features

- Every delivery state transition is appended to a durable `delivery_events` log, so what happened to an occurrence survives log rotation and restarts. The same correlation id ties a scheduler run, a download, an outbox row, its delivery and any operator action together.
- Readiness deferrals are now recorded distinctly from failures and never consume a delivery attempt; the readiness probe reports a structured reason (connection refused, timeout, HTTP status) instead of a bare boolean.
- Added `pixivflow runs list` and `pixivflow runs show <executionId>` execution summaries, and `outbox inspect` prints the full event trail with deferred rows separated from attempt-consuming ones.
- Delivery errors are classified into typed classes, and secrets (URL credentials, headers, Bearer/token/cookie values) are redacted in logs and audit records.
- Build identity is baked into the package at build time: `pixivflow --version` reports the exact version and commit.

## [2.14.0](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/compare/v2.13.0...v2.14.0) (2026-09-10)

### Features

- Cache-mode illustration delivery can send aligned Pixiv previews alongside immutable originals.
- Delivery targets can define a readiness endpoint; outbox consumption waits without consuming attempts.
- Added `pixivflow outbox` list, inspect, dead-letter retry, and pending-intent cancel operations.

## [2.13.0](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/compare/v2.12.3...v2.13.0) (2026-09-09)

### Bug Fixes

* **delivery:** actually send occurrence-scoped idempotency_key in multipart content delivery (was generated but never transmitted; ACK-loss retry could double-post / misclassify as historical duplicate) ([4f1b377](https://github.com/redtidev1918/PixivFlow/commit/4f1b377703964f895da897012b13e92f96db545e))
